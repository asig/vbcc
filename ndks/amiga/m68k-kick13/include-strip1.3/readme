1. Current printer include files (required for writing 1.3 printer
   drivers).

2. New include files devices/scsidisk.h and .i, devices/hardblocks.h and .i.

3. Lib/ddebug.lib - a parallel counterpart to debug.lib output functions.
   Useful for debugging serial applications, or debugging low level
   code to a parallel printer.  Has the same output functions as debug.lib,
   but the names start with 'd' instead of 'k'.  See debug.lib docs
   in the AW RKM Exec manual.

4. Offs1.3/Structure.offs list by Kodiak.  A list of Amiga structure
   sizes and structure member offsets.  Handy for debugging.

5. Startups/startup1.3/ - a new startup module, startup.asm, which can
   be conditionally assembled into a number of different startup.obj's
   including an Astartup replacement, reentrant startups, window startup,
   reentrant window startup (like More's), and no-arg startups.
   Six different pre-assembled varieties are included, along with
   two tutorials - UsingAmigaStartups and WritingReentrantC.
