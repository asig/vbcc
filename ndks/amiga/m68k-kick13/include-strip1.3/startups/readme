1.3 Startup Code
================

This directory currently contains

startup1.2 (dir):
   The old 1.2 Astartup and TWstartup codes, and a startup.doc which
   explains what kinds of programs can be linked with these Amiga
   startups, how to link with them, etc.

startup1.3 (dir):
   The latest version of [R]startup.asm, the new reentrant Amiga startup
   code, and two tutorials, UsingAmigaStartups and WritingReentrantC.
   This version of [R]startup has not been heavily tested yet, but it 
   does not have the subtle bug that the devcon version had in its abort
   logic (described below).  If you are not sure if you can use these 
   startups, read the UsingAmigaStartups.  If you want to write
   reentrant code, also read WritingReentrantC.

   oldrstart (dir):
      The earlier (devcon) version of [r]startup.asm.  A bug was found
      in the abort logic of this version.  If a program was started from
      Workbench, and there was enough memory for the program to be
      loaded and createproc'd, but there was not a small piece of memory 
      left for the startup's allocation of the argument buffers and
      startup variables, the abort logic did not get or reply the
      Workbench message.  This would cause the program to not be unloaded
      by Workbench under this abort condition.
