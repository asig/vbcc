Amiga.lib
=========

This is the 1.3 Amiga.lib.  It should include new stubs/LVO's for all
of the new 1.3 mathieee and diskfont functions.

Mathieeedoubbas_lib.lib, mathieeedoubtrans_lib.lib, and diskfont_lib.lib
have also been provided individually for any developers who might need
them in that form.

Debug.lib and Ddebug.lib
========================

Debug.lib is a low level 9600 baud serial debugging library, containing
serial input and output functions as described in Appendix B of the
Addison-Wesley Rom Kernel Manual Exec.  Debug.lib is useful for debugging
when you are unable to use stdio output. (iei, within tasks, interrupts,
drivers, etc.)
  
Ddebug.lib is a parallel version of debug.lib.
It is useful for debugging serial applications, or for debugging to
a parallel printer when a serial terminal is not available.
The functions have the same names as those in debug.lib except the
initial 'k' is instead 'd' (example dprintf() instead of kprintf()).
Only the debug.lib output functions have been implemented in ddebug.lib.


Small.lib
=========

Small.lib is an abbreviated Amiga.lib for assembler programmers who
only require the LVO's.
