   This "FinalUpdate" directory contains the few files needed to update
your 1.3 Omega 7 kit to Final.

   Small.lib is a small linker lib useful for assembler programmers.  It
contains only the LVO's from Amiga.lib.

   The Includes subdirectory contains the four include files which changed
between Omega 7 and release.  MODE_READWRITE 1004 was added to both the
libraries/dos.h and dos.i files.  And the comments in devices/prtgfx.h
and prtgfx.i file were changed to mark private printer.device fields as
PRIVATE - DO NOT USE.
