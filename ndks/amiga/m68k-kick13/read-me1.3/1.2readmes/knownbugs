KNOWN 1.2 BUGS
==============

    1. ScrollRaster() left or right in a SuperBitmap window can consume
       memory if there is no TmpRas attached to the window's RastPort.
       Workaround: allocate/initialize/attach a TmpRas

    2. Memory can be corrupted if a Drawer in the Ram Disk window is
       discarded via the WorkBench menu selection "Discard".
       (Note - this is caused by ExNext() on already deleted files)
       Workaround: Delete from CLI or open the drawer and discard
                   contents of the drawer before discarding drawer.

    3. A SPECIAL_FULLCOLS|SPECIAL_FULLROWS dumprport request with
       0 specified for DestCols and DestRows will improperly result
       in an aspected dump.  
       Workaround: Specify a non-zero value for DestCols and DestRows

    4. Delay(0) or WaitForChar(file,n) where n is a very low number
       or especially 0 or 1, can cause a timer device problem
       leading to trashed disks.

       Developers Note:
          WaitForChar() can't be used on a interactive stream.

    5. In a pre-drawn requester, it is reported that string gadgets
       can not be used because their text is not rendered.

    6. It is reported that MODE_READWRITE does not work in ram:.
