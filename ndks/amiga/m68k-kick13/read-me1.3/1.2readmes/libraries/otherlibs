info.library
============
fixed bug wherein info would not respond to info-request of a disk
on which no Disk.info is present.
Also can now create a Disk.info if user selects
SAVE.version.library,use this to get the current workbench version
number.

new info.library to fix the add-tooltypes bug



layers.library
==============
Fix of SizeLayer/MoveLayer with superbitmap window.
It used to trash the bits if the scroll position was other than 0,0.

BeginUpdate now assumes it has enough memory unless proven otherwise.



math libraries
==============
mathffp now supports Ceil, Floor

IEEEDPFix() in mathieeedoubbas.library now returns 0 instead of the 
error value 107 when there is an overflow.

The ieee double precision math library should now be re-entrant .


mathtrans
=========
ArcSin/ArcCos routines re-written.
They are about 2000% faster and give better results for Sin ~= 1.



ramlib
======
New ramlib breaks recursion path when out of memory:
it used to be that we might try and UnLoadSeg() when
out of memory.  If you had a small stack (under 1500
bytes left) you would get blown out of the water.

The new ramlib now uses its own copy of unloadseg, which
only requres 200 bytes.

There is still some potential bugs in the disk handler
with insufficient stack space.


strap
=====
finally recoded to NOT open Intuition.


translator
==========
new translator.doc released
