EXEC
====

        expansion architecture now in kickstart!
        Big side affect is that many system data structures should   
        now appear in fast memory if it is available. This is true of
        SysBase and GfxBase. So beware!
        Bug fix, exec now correctly sets AFB_68881 in AttnFlags
        No more multitasking problems with 68020/68881 combinations 
(RSN)

Moderate changes to exec.  Two feature areas: we now have support
for finding code modules in ram at system bring up time (this lets
us ignore or add to modules in ROM) This new exec has a fully working 
"romtags in ram" facility.  This
will allow one to override individual modules in kickstart.  In
addition, new modules may be added to the system.

In addition several bugs were fixed.  AllocAbs() was rewritten from
scratch to make it work.  The exec library structure was not properly
kept-- LIB_POSSIZE and LIB_NEGSIZE were incorrect.  In addition exec
used to write over the top of legal memory on system boot.

included seperate file, the latest exec.doc
Exec has new functions to deal with SignalSemaphore's.

There is one open design issue on this stuff.  Because this "romtags
in ram" is ram-based, there is a possibility of trashing the list
due to an errant program.  Currently the "directory" information
for the ramtags is checksummed, but not the actual code and data.
This makes it possible to link in normal C code.  However, it
means that a program can be trashed and your system will infinitely
loop, until the machine is powered off.

New functions:  AddMemList()   adds memory to the system
                InitSemaphore(), ObtainSemaphore()  for signal
                           
semaphores
               CopyMem()   fast, safe memory mover
               SumKickData()

For more information, see the autodocs.

Finally, of interest only for those of us who write exec code, exec
will ignore the old execbase if the version or revision of exec
has changed.

exec/alerts.h exec/alerts.i
there is a new revision of
alerts.h and alerts.i... removed "unused" alerts from
graphics.library section of alerts.h and .i
added "new" alerts to the same section 

has support for the 68881 in a multitasking environment.  Also has some
of its autodocs changed to the "new" format.  

Bug fix to AttemptSemaphore.
Finally has the docs for the semaphores (they were in the wrong format 
before, so didn't get included).

Fix to FindTask().  You can now use FindTask to find yourself.

There was a bug in exec when using 68881 & 68020, specifically in
saving/restoring a "mid-instruction stack frame".  It's fixed.

exec now has has a different alert text if it is a recoverable alert.

Two changes:  freeing zero bytes of memory will no longer cause an alert
(this fixes 1.1 serial.device); and processor traps now alert as
"software failure" rather than "recoverable alert" (this is a bug
introduced in beta-6).
