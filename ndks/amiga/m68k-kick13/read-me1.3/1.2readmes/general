These documents describe changes made to the Amiga system
software between Releases 1.1 and 1.2.

General Information
===================

1.2 Release Version Number
==========================

This release of kickstart will have library version number 33. Use 
this version number in OpenLibrary if you are using new 1.2 functions
or features.  Abort gracefully if the OpenLibrary fails.



PAL Support
===========

- This release can be used with either PAL or NTSC; if your Amiga has
the proper custom chip for PAL, you get 256 horizonal lines on the
display (512 if you've chosen Workbench Interlace in Preferences) and
the 50 Hz refresh rate required by the PAL standard.

- THIS RELEASE ALSO DETECTS THE FREQUENCY OF THE AC LINE CURRENT
(EITHER 50 or 60 Hz) AND AUTOMTICALLY USES THE RIGHT FREQUENCY WHEN
UPDATING THE AMIGA'S INTERNAL CLOCK. 



Peripherals
===========

- Long-persistence monitors are now available that work well for
interlaced displays (third party).

- You can now use 5-1/4" disk drives with your Amiga 5-1/4" disks can
be used as limited-capacity Amiga disks To install a new disk drive,
see the description of the CLI mount command in "New Information for
the 1.2 AmigaDOS User's Manual" that follows.  Mount the drive as
df1: / Unit 1 if you have no external 3 1/2, as df2: / Unit 2 if you do.
