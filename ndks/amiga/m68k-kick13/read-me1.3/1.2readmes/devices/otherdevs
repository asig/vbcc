audio
=====
audio.device now resets audio channels audio channels whenever they are
allocated instead of only when they are freed or stolen.


console.device
==============
The new console device re-establishes a keymap conversion buffer size of 127
in a manner that won't blow up. This means that keys can be mapped to longer 
strings.  It also fixes the sporatic errors reported from the console write 
command.  The autodoc "rawinput.doc" is also updated.


disk resource
=============
The disk resource was the cause of the extra
reset after kickstarting.  This was a bug introduced early in the 1.2
process, but was so benign that it was ignored.  It's now fixed.
         

narrator
========
new narrator.doc released


parallel.device
===============
A new parallel device exists.  It not only has improved autodocs, but the Query
function no longer tends to get "one"ey with each use (ORing w/o masking first).


rawinput
========
Two bugs fixed, both doing with IO QUICK requests.  The first is that
AddHandler, RemHandler, and AddEvent did not clear the quick bit
when they did not complete the event immediately.

The other bug is a race condition, where requests that are processed in
the input task might get processed before "beginio" path is done with them
(because the input task runs at a higher priority, and does not forbid
around its critical path).  Fixed with a bandaid -- handler routines
ALWAYS clear the quick bit.


serial
======
MARK/SPACE now supported by serial device.

The serial device has been fixed so that it does not touch bits in
the CIA's registers that are not related to the serial port.

A new improved serial device now waits 12 seconds, rather than 90 
microseconds, before giving up on CTS/RTS handshaking.


trackdisk
=========
The documentation for trackdisk driver is now on the disk
New trackdisk.doc

        actual step rate now down to 3.6msec. The specs for fine tuning this
        are in this directory. look at trackdisk.h
        See tdu_StepDelay,tdu_SettleDelay.
        These parameters are extremely hardware dependant!  This     
        means that values that may work for a 68000 may not work for a
        68010 as well as a 68020 or a faster clock, etc. If you decide
        the ^[ ^] keys do not generate correct ascii codes.

that you must play with this the be aware of the consequences.

timing problem with 68020 and new external disk drives fixed.
