new printer device
bug fix, now handles character >=160

printer.device:
no more memory loss when canceling a print.
supports PAL screen sizes.
Only does an aRIN (which produces a linefeed) if printer preference variables
are changed.

The printer.device now only reloads the printer dependent
portion when necessary. (finally!)
The printer device code to only reinitialize the printer when
preferences have been changed now works.
All printers now have a defined extended character set for
characters > 159. (ie, the Amiga foreign characters)
The Okimate-20 now supports colored text.  (But don't use it
unless you have a LOT of ribbons available.)

printer.device: DISABLE/ENABLE now surround the printer status checking code.

New imagewriter driver is now available. 
This one has improved foreign constructed characters.

Some of the printers had their extended character sets turned
off in the last release.  This has been corrected.

There is a new driver for the ibm compatible okidata292.

The printer device no longer crashes in the following case:
- it tries to put up a requester to tell the user to turn on the printer.  
- it checks the WindowPtr field in the calling  process's Process structure 
- the WindowPtr field is a -1 (indicating that all error messages
are to be returned to the calling program)
The new printer device returns a PD_CANCEL (== 1) instead of crashing
and burning.

By the way, tasks calling the printer.device work as before, always putting
up the error requester in the workbench screen.

Problem: Okimate prints English pound sign instead of #.
This also happens using the PAR: device, and V1.1.  This
seems to be something in the printer's ROMs, rather than
something we can effect.

Printer device can now properly dump HAM screens that modify
off border color in the first pixel of a scan line.
