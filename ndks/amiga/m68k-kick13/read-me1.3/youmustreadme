3. WHAT'S PROBABLY INCLUDED

   Documents (Paper Things)

      Cover Letter - Your responsibilities as a Gamma Tester

      Bug Report   - One of your responsibilities

      Command Docs - Cover additions and enhancements to Workbench
                     commands, handlers, etc.
      
   Disks (Hard square things)

      Kickstart 1.2.1.   - Current 1.3 KS by a different name
      Workbench 1.3 o6   - Gamma 4 pre-release of 1.3 Workbench
      Extras 1.3 o6      - Gamma 4 Extras (some WB things have moved here)
      Readme1.3o6        - Preliminary readmes and examples, new autodocs
      Include1.3o6       - Commented Asm and C include files
      Include.Strip1.3o6 - Stripped includes, fd's, offsets, startups,
                             and a few utilities
   

4. WHAT'S WHERE

   1.2.1 Kickstart - Equivalent to current 1.3 Kickstart except the
                     hand says "1.2.1." and everything else is
                     probably at a slightly different address than
                     in the version that says "1.3".  So don't even
                     think about patching this.

                     1.3 (and 1.2.1) Kickstart is 1.2 Kickstart with
                     additional code for autobooting off specially
                     designed devices.  Generally such devices would
                     be autoboot expansion devices with ROM driver on
                     board.  If you don't have one of those yet
                     (and you probably don't unless your company is
                     making one), you can still Have Fun With Autoboot
                     by playing with the Rebootable Ramdrive.

                     Read about Autoboot in the Autoboot1.3 drawer.


   1.3o6 Workbench - Some New things on Workbench:

                       C/

                         Lots of enhancements for your CLI enjoyment.
                         In conjunction with assorted magic from some
                         other directories, the C directory is proud
                         to announce AmigaShell! Resident! Scripts
                         without Execute!  (Andy was a Very Busy Bee)
                         And FastFonts ("FF") by Charlie Heath!

                       S/

                         New Cli-startup file for every resident cli.

                       DEVS/

                         New printer.device and drivers
                          More drivers are on the Extras disk.  Faster
                          and full of neat new features.  Massive docs
                          in the ReadMe:Printer1.3 drawer.  And lots
                          of example 1.3 printer driver sources!

                         Ramdrive.device
                          Recoverable Ram Drive that you can REBOOT
                          off with 1.3 (1.2.1) Kickstart!  Under 1.2
                          it's still recoverable but not rebootable
                          (of course), and under 1.2 you must remount
                          it after rebooting.  You can only have one
                          of these.  There's a mountlist entry for it,
                          currently called CARD: (CommodoreAmigaRamDrive).
                          It used to be called rd0: but since you can
                          only have one we thought that was a bad choice.
                          If you can think of a better unused name, let
                          us know.  Mount CARD:, Format it, then if
                          you're using 1.3 (1.2.1.) KS, pull your df0:
                          disk and CTRL/AMIGA/AMIGA.  Nice, eh ?
                          (nicer, of course, if you copy some of your
                          Workbench in there so you don't Reboot into
                          default city).

                       New Preferences
                         Select new printer features and even override
                          the type of dump an application has selected.
                          Read about it in ReadMe:Workbench1.3 drawer.

                       L/
                          Lots of new handlers and the new FastFileSystem.
                          Read about FFS in ReadMe/Workbench1.3.
                          Read about new handlers in the Command docs.

                       LIBS/

                         Double precision ieee libraries that can use
                           68881 (coprocessor or peripheral) if one
                           is available.  Read about IEEE in the ReadMe
                           Workbench1.3 drawer.  Autodocs are in the
                           Autodocs1.3 drawer. New linker .lib's and fd's
                           are on the Include.strip disk.

                         New diskfont.library with two new functions
                           for updating fonts directory after changes
                           have been made.  Autodoc is in the Autodocs1.3
                           drawer.
                           
                       SYSTEM/ and UTILITIES/

                         Various enhancements including a new More that
                           can be run and works with our pipe, and a
                           new Graphicdump with built-in size options.


   1.3g4 Extras -    AmigaBasic is unchanged.  PCUtils are unchanged.
                     Some utilities are unchanged.  But you'll notice
                     that many of the printer drivers and keymaps have
                     been moved here to make room for new utilities
                     and handlers on Workbench.  This is where the new
                     Adobe fonts will probably be on final Extras1.3.

                     
   ReadMe1.3g4 -     All docs which are currently available for new
                     1.3 features (except for command docs which are
                     supplied on paper).  Docs for ieee, FFS, Prefs,
                     Autoboot, Printer.  Some IEEE examples and lots
                     of examples printer drivers.  Autodocs which have
                     changed for 1.3.  Electronic bug report form.

                     startups.  Amiga.lib, debug.lib, new parallel

                     and ieee.  Alink, atom, and stripa.
