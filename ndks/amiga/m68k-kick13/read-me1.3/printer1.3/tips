	Tips for Generating Better/Faster Graphic Dumps
	-----------------------------------------------

	Faster
	------

1. If you are dumping a 1 bitplane image select the B&W mode in preferences.
   This is much faster than a grey-scale or color dump.

2. Horizontal dumps are much faster than vertical dumps as they use the
   blitter to read the pixel data.

3. Smoothing doubles the print time.  Use it for final copy only.

4. F-S dithering doubles the print time.  Ordered and halftone dithering
   incur no extra overhead.

5. The lower the density the faster the printout.


	Better
	------

1. Friction fed paper tends to be much more accurate than tractor fed
   paper in terms of vertical dot placement (ie. less horizontal strips or
   white lines).

2. Densities which use more than one pass tend to produce 'muddy' grey-scale
   or color printouts.  It is recommended that you not chose these densities
   when doing a grey-scale or color dump.
