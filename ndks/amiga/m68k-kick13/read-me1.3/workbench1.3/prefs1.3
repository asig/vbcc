                           ===============
                           by  Eric Cotton


The new Preferences program has a number of additions to support new features
of the V1.3 release, including extended printer support.  Changes from V1.2
Preferences are as follows:


  Main Screen

    o	Selecting Save or Use automatically updates the battery backed up
	clock with the new date and time.

    o	The CLI On/Off option has been eliminated.  Henceforth, the icon for
	the Command Line Interface (CLI) will always appear in the System
	drawer (unless deleted by the user).


  Printer Screen 1

    o	The Graphic Select gadget has been replaced by two new gadgets:
	Graphic 1 and Graphic 2.

    o	The new Graphic 1 gadget is equivalent the the V1.2 Graphic Select
	gadget and is used to request the first of two printer graphic
	Preferences screens.


  Printer Screen 2 (Graphic 1)

    o	The Printer Screen 2 is selected by clicking on the Graphic 1 gadget
	in Printer Screen 1.

    o	There is a new Print Shade selection: Gray Scale2.  This shade is for
	printing pictures designed using the *Hedley Monitor* (when only
	seven shades of gray are available).


  Printer Screen 3 (Graphic 2)

    This is a totally new Preferences screen to allow for extended printer
    graphics support.  The various gadgets are as follows:

    o	Antialiasing ON/OFF - Antialiasing (when ON) attempts to smooth
	diagonal lines.  This option is best suited for use with programs that
	do graphic dumps of text (like ProWrite, PageSetter, CityDesk,
	Publisher 1000, NotePad, etc.).  Note that this option automatically
	turns off Floyd-Steinberg dithering (and selects Ordered dithering)
	as they can not be used in conjunction with each other.

    o	Left Offset - The printed picture is offset horizontally in increments
	of tenths of an inch.  The 'Center Image' option (below) disables this
	option.

    o	Center ON/OFF - This turns on/off horizontal centering of the picture
	on the paper.  This option overrides the Left Offset value.

    o	Density 1 through 7 - This is used to override any density an
	application program has selected and thus ensure a certain density.
	The lower the density the faster the print time (on those printers
	with multiple densities).

    o	Color Correction R/G/B - This option selectively tries to match all
	shades of either red (R), green (G), or blue (B) from the screen
	to the printer.  Initially the printer device can print all the 4096
	colors of the AMIGA on a printer.  However, as color correction is
	applied the total number of printed colors is reduced to a low of 3172.
	To see the effect of this option, print out a picture with solid red,
	green, and blue shades twice;  first with this option on, and then with
	it off.  Now compare the two pictures with the screen display.  The
	results should be obvious.

    o	Dithering Ordered/Halftone/F-S

	Ordered - Color intensities on the printer are formed using an
	  'ordered' dither method.  This is the default.

	Halftone - Color intensities on the printer are formed using a
	  'halftone' dither method.  This technique is similar to the one
	  used in newspapers and comic books and works best on high density
	  printers (greater than 150 dots/inch).

	F/S - Color intensities on the printer are formed using the
	  'Floyd-Steinberg' error distribution method.  Note that selecting
	  this option automatically turns off Antialiasing as they can not
	  be used in conjunction with each other.

    o	Scaling Fraction/Integer

	Fraction - Performs normal scaling.  This is the default.

	Integer  - every dot on the screen is guaranteed to appear as an even
	  number of dots on the printer both in the x and y dimension.  Ie. if
	  the source picture is 320 x 200, the printed picture width will be
	  either 320, 640, 960, etc. dots wide and 200, 400, 600, etc. dots
	  high.  SELECT THIS OPTION WHEN TRYING TO PRINT A PICTURE THAT
	  CONTAINS THIN VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL LINES (LIKE A GRID).  The
	  actual size of the printed picture will be the size asked for scaled
	  up/down to the nearest multiple of the width and height of the
	  picture.  Integer scaling will completely override the aspecting
	  feature of the printer device.  Ie. it is possible to get a
	  slightly distorted (non-aspect ratio correct) picture.  This option
	  is also usefull if you are printing out bit-image text (like in
	  notepad) as the fonts will not be distorted due to fractional scaling.

    o Width Limit - This selection limits the width of the printed picture in
	tenths / inch.

    o Height Limit - This limits the height of the printed picture in
	tenths / inch.

    o <- Limits  - This gadget determines how the above Width and Height
	limits are to be interpreted as follows:

	Ignore - The limits are to be IGNORED.  The printed picture's size is
	  bounded by:

	  width =  (right margin - left margin + 1) / characters per inch.
	  height = lines per page / lines per inch.

	  This option is included to remain compatible with pre V1.3 software
	  and is the default.

	Bounded - The printed picture's size is bounded by Width Limit and
	  Height Limit.  Ie. if you want the printed picture to be no bigger
	  than 4 x 5 (but it could be smaller), set MaxWidth to 40, MaxHeight
	  to 50, and select Bounded.  This option is here so that the text
	  settings (margins, lines per page, etc.) need not be changed
	  everytime a graphic print is made.

	ABSOLUTE - Width Limit and Height Limit are taken to be absolute values.
	  The printed picture's size is no longer bounded.  Rather, it will
	  be the absolute size specified.  For example, if you want the
	  printed picture to be exactly 4.0 x 5.0 inches,  set MaxWidth to 40,
	  Width Limit to 50, and select Absolute.  This will completely
	  override the aspecting feature of the printer device.  Thus it is
	  possible to get a very distorted (non-aspect ratio correct) picture.
	  Setting one (but not both) of the dimensions to zero aspect ratio
	  corrects that dimension.  Ie. if Width Limit is set to 40 and Height
	  Limit to 0, then the printed picture will be 4.0 inches wide and as
	  tall as it needs to be in order to be aspect ratio correct.  If both
	  of the dimensions are zero then the printed picture will be the
	  printer's maximum dots wide and as tall as it needs to be in order to
	  be aspect ratio correct.

	Pixels - Width Limit and Height Limit are taken to be absolute values in
	  printer pixels and not tenths of an inch.  Otherwise, the same rules
	  for the Absolute selection (Width Limit = 0 and Height Limit = 0)
	  apply here.

	Multiply - Width Limit and Height Limit are used to multiply the
	  source picture's width and height.  Ie., if you specified a Width
	  Limit	of 2 and a Height Limit of 4, the printed picture would be
	  two times the	source picture's width pixels wide and 4x the source
	  picture's height pixels high.  Thus if the source picture were
	  320 x 200, the printed picture would be 640 (320 x 2) pixels wide
	  and 800 (200 x 4) pixels high.  The same rules for the Absolute
	  scaling (Width Limit = 0 and Height Limit = 0) apply.  Also, the
	  benefits that apply to Integer scaling are valid here.
